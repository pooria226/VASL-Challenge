# 🎮 ReactJS Code Challenges – Game Edition

Welcome!  
This repository is used as a **code challenge** for front-end / React developers who want to join our team.

You will choose **one** of the games below, implement it using **React** (and optionally TypeScript, CSS/Tailwind, etc.), and submit your solution as a **Pull Request**.

## 📌 Available Challenges

Detailed descriptions are in [`CHALLENGES.md`](./CHALLENGES.md), but here’s the list:

1. Tic-Tac Strategy
2. Memory Card Flip Game
3. Color Guessing Game
4. Sliding Puzzle (15 Puzzle)
5. Knight’s Hunt on the Chessboard
6. Minesweeper (Mine-Sweeper Game)
7. Conway’s Game of Life

Pick **one** that fits your skills and interests best.  
Implementing more than one is optional but not required.

## 🧱 Tech Requirements

- Must use **React** (plain React, Vite, CRA, Next.js, etc. are all acceptable).
- You **may** use:
  - TypeScript
  - CSS / SCSS / CSS Modules / Tailwind
  - Any UI library (MUI, shadcn, etc.)
- Keep it **simple, readable, and maintainable**. We care more about:
  - Clean code and structure
  - Good state management and logic
  - Reusable components
  - Reasonable folder structure
  - Clear UX and reasonable styling

No need for pixel-perfect designs or heavy architecture. Clarity > complexity.

## 📂 Project Structure & Naming

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. In the root of your fork, create a folder named:

   ```txt
   yourName-challengeName
   ```

   Examples:

   ```txt
   alexSmith-tic-tac-strategy
   johnDoe-game-of-life
   ```

3. Inside that folder, create your project:

   ```txt
   yourName-challengeName/
   ├─ README.md          // how to run, tech stack, notes
   ├─ package.json
   ├─ src/
   └─ ...
   ```

You can use any React setup you prefer, as long as we can run it locally.

## ▶️ Candidate README Requirements

Inside **your** project folder (`yourName-challengeName/README.md`), please describe:

- Which challenge you implemented
- Your chosen tech stack (React + anything else)
- How to install and run the project, for example:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

- Any assumptions, limitations, or known issues
- Optional: What you would improve with more time

We should be able to clone your fork, install, and run the game with minimal effort.

## ✅ What We Evaluate

We’ll look at:

- Code structure & readability
- Component design and reusability
- State management (hooks, context, etc.)
- Handling of edge cases
- UX / UI clarity and feedback
- How you handle game rules and constraints
- Commit history (nice to have, not mandatory)

We are **not** expecting a production-ready app, but we want to see how you think, design, and write front-end code.

---

## ⏱ Time Expectations

We don’t expect you to spend a huge amount of time on this.

- Focus on:
  - Completing the **core game logic**
  - Having a **working UI**
  - Writing **clean, understandable** code

Polish is welcome but secondary to clarity and correctness.

---

## 🧠 Ambiguities & Assumptions

If anything in the challenge description feels unclear or missing:

- Make a reasonable assumption.
- Document it in your project `README.md` or your Pull Request description.

Creativity, initiative, and good communication are highly appreciated.

---

## 🛠 Notes

- You may use any additional libraries, but **simpler is usually better**.
- Do not use AI-generated code without understanding and owning it.
- Make sure your code reflects your own skills and style.

Happy coding! We’re excited to see what you build. 🚀
